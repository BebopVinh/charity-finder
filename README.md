# Charity Finder

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate

With the Charity Finder app you'll not only get to refine your Web Developer
skills, but you will also have an opportunity to see how you can do good. The
objective of this app is to utilize the [Global Giving](https://www.globalgiving.org/) organizations API to provide your users with a list of global charities they
can search to find a charity that matches their philanthropic interests.

### Constraints

- Since the app is asking the user to choose and contribute to a charitable
  cause it's important that the presentation of information be clear and concise.
  Just as important is the need for the UI/UX to be polished and engaging to use.

  Although this is true of all apps, its even more the case here since each
  user that abandons the site represents the loss of an opportunity to do good
  (see ['What is Web Site Conversion?](##useful-links-and-resources)) below.

## User Stories
